# Hey, I'm Hyukoo

Officially, my name is Hyeokwoo, but I go by Hyukoo (`/hju.ku/`) because it's just a little bit simpler to spell.

I'm a software engineer based in Seoul, specializing in frontend development, particularly JavaScript (TypeScript) and other web technologies. I have over 5 years of professional experience in the field. If you are curious about my past works, check out my [projects](https://hyukoo.one/projects).


This website showcases my online presence, with a primary focus on my work in software engineering.

Beyond software engineering, I'm currently active in fencing. I also practice Korean traditional archery, a long-standing passion of mine. Additionally, I've explored other physical activities such as jiu-jitsu, yoga, and figure skating, though I didn't pursue these for as long.
